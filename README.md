# ⚠️ EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH PROJECT

**This is a higher education thesis project investigating AI-generated code security through iterative prompting.**

## Research Purpose

This repository demonstrates the security capabilities and limitations of AI-assisted development. We investigate: **"How secure can data transfer between systems become when using AI assistants with iterative security-focused prompting?"**

### Research Methodology

1. **Baseline Generation**: Prompted AI (Claude, ChatGPT) to create complete police/hospital data-sharing system
2. **Security Testing**: Used nmap and OWASP ZAP to identify data-in-transit vulnerabilities
3. **Iterative Improvement**: Re-prompted AI with security requirements based on test results
4. **Analysis**: Measured how effectively AI can generate secure data transfer code when explicitly asked

**Key Finding**: AI assistants generate functional but potentially insecure code. This project documents whether and how security can be improved through better prompting.

## ⚠️ WARNING: RESEARCH CODE - NOT PRODUCTION-READY

- All systems use **fictitious data** (no real personal information)
- Code generated by AI assistants **for security analysis**
- Security testing tools included for **controlled research only**
- Contains vulnerabilities typical of **AI-generated code without security review**
- **NO real systems, NO operational use, NO sensitive data**

## Legal Notice

This is a student academic project at Yrgo, Higher Vocational Education, Gothenburg.

**Unauthorized use of included security testing tools on systems you don't own is illegal.** These tools (nmap, OWASP ZAP) were used exclusively on locally-hosted development servers with fictitious data for academic research purposes.

## Research Questions

1. **Can AI generate secure data transfer code when explicitly prompted for security?**
2. **What security gaps persist even with security-focused prompts?**

## Research Scope

**Focus Area**: Data-in-transit security between independent systems

**In Scope:**

- Encryption of data transfer (HTTP/HTTPS)
- API endpoint security for cross-system communication
- CORS policies and cross-origin requests
- Exposure of sensitive data during transfer
- Database-level flag synchronization security

**Explicitly Out of Scope:**

- User authentication/authorization (not part of this research)
- Database security (separate concern)
- Application-level vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS)
- Infrastructure/server configuration
- GDPR compliance

## Academic Context

- **Institution**: Yrgo, Higher Vocational Education, Gothenburg
- **Program**: Web Development
- **Thesis Topic**: Security Analysis of AI-Generated Code with Iterative Prompting
- **Status**: Active Research Project
