# Security Notice

## ⚠️ Important Context

**The security vulnerabilities in this codebase were generated by AI assistants** - not manually introduced by the researchers. This is AI-generated code being studied for security analysis.

We prompted AI tools to create functional systems, accepted the generated code with no modifications, and then tested it to evaluate AI's security capabilities. Vulnerabilities found are evidence of gaps in AI-generated code, not intentional backdoors.

## Research Objective

### Use Case

Two fictitious systems (police and hospital) share data about violent individuals via flag synchronization. We focus specifically on **data-in-transit security** - not authentication, authorization, or internal system security.

### Research Methodology

1. **Initial Generation**: Prompted AI to create complete data transfer system
2. **Security Testing**: Used nmap and OWASP ZAP to identify vulnerabilities in data transfer
3. **Iterative Improvement**: Re-prompted AI with security requirements to improve the code
4. **Analysis**: Documented how AI responds to security-focused prompts and whether it can generate secure data transfer mechanisms

### What We're Measuring

- ✅ Can AI generate secure data transfer code when explicitly asked?
- ✅ What security gaps does AI leave even with security prompts?
- ✅ What security practices does AI include/omit by default?

### Scope Limitations

**In Scope (What We Test):**

- Encryption of data transfer (HTTP/HTTPS)
- API endpoint security for cross-system communication
- CORS policies and cross-origin requests
- Exposure of sensitive data during transfer
- Database-level flag synchronization security

**Out of Scope (Acknowledged but Not Focus):**

- User authentication/authorization
- Database security
- Application-level vulnerabilities
- Infrastructure/server configuration
- GDPR compliance

### Purpose of Security Testing Tools

The `testing/` directory contains penetration testing tools used to:

- Evaluate security of AI-generated data transfer code
- Identify vulnerabilities to address in next prompting iteration
- Document the effectiveness of security-focused prompts

### Ethical Use Statement

These tools were used exclusively on:

- ✅ Locally-hosted development servers (localhost)
- ✅ Fictitious data sets (no real personal information)
- ✅ Systems we own and control
- ✅ Controlled academic research environment

❌ **DO NOT** use these scripts on systems you don't own or without authorization.
