# 1 - Project Setup (with Claude Sonnet 4.5)

## Prompt 1.1

Task: Generate Simple Project Structure
Create a minimal project structure for a thesis project where two IT systems (police and hospital) share data securely.
Requirements:

- Backend: Rust + PostgreSQL (two separate databases)
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Two simple user interfaces (one for police, one for hospital)
- Basic API for data exchange between systems
  Deliverables:

1. Simple folder structure (monorepo with both systems)
2. Brief description of key folders only
3. Basic architecture explanation
   Focus on:

- Minimal viable structure - only essential folders and files
- Clear separation between police and hospital systems
- Simple, beginner-friendly organization
- Easy to understand and navigate
  Avoid: Docker, advanced DevOps, complex tooling configurations, over-engineering.

## Prompt 1.2

Make a complete setup guide according to the simple project structure you just generated

## Prompt 1.3

Make a readme-file for the file structure
(Claude named this ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Prompt 1.4 (with GPT-5)

Write a complete PostgreSQL SQL setup script that creates two separate databases â€” police_db and hospital_db. Each database should contain only one table: police_db.individuals and hospital_db.patients. Both tables should include columns id, full_name, personal_id, and flag. The flag column should be a boolean in both tables, and any change to the flag in police_db.individuals should automatically mirror to hospital_db.patients where personal_id matches. Use postgres_fdw to implement the synchronization. Include everything needed for setup, including extension creation, foreign server setup, user mapping and trigger definition. Do not include comments, make it copy-and-paste friendly.

## Prompt 1.4 (with Claude Sonnet 4.5)

Create a comprehensive quick guide document for setting up and using PostgreSQL with VS Code on Mac OS. The guide should be titled 'PostgreSQL Quick Guide' and include the following sections:

1. Prerequisites (Mac OS, Homebrew, VSCode, PostgreSQL)
2. How to start PostgreSQL (with both generic and version-specific commands using brew services)
3. How to stop PostgreSQL
4. Step-by-step instructions for setting up a database schema, including:
   - Creating a postgres superuser
   - Running a schema file located at 'shared/database-schemas/schema.sql'
   - Verifying the database was created successfully
5. A troubleshooting section for the common 'role does not exist' error
   Format it in clear markdown with code blocks for all terminal commands. Keep the tone professional but concise. Make it practical and easy to follow for developers who are new to PostgreSQL.
